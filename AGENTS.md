# AGENTS.md

## Bootstrap

If this repository was just created from the template, run `/bootstrap` before anything else. Delete this section once the project is set up.

## Project

[What this project is and what it covers, two sentences at most.]

## Architecture

[Main components and how they connect, a few lines.]

Only what an agent needs to place a change correctly. The why is in ADRs.

## Layout

| Path | Holds |
| --- | --- |
| `[path]` | [What lives there] |

One row per top-level directory; deeper only where the tree alone would not tell an agent where a change belongs.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `[command]` | [What it does] |

Design each command for who runs it: agent-facing commands run without interaction, accept a scope where one applies and print only what an agent needs. Agent-facing commands are listed here, human-facing ones in README.md, shared ones in both.

## Economy

**Context.** Everything committed to this repository is read by every agent that works here later: code, comments, docs, tests, ADRs and this file. Every token that carries no necessary information costs money and dilutes attention on the information that matters. Each kind of knowledge has one home: the **why** in ADRs, the **what** in documentation, the **how** in the code.

**Time.** Every check, run and read costs time. Do each once, at the narrowest scope that proves what you need, and skip anything your change cannot affect.

## Git

Never run a command that alters git history or the remote (commit, amend, rebase, merge, reset, cherry-pick, push, tag, branch deletion) without explicit approval from the user for that specific command. Approval covers one action and never carries over to the next.

## Code

- Follow industry best practice. No over-engineering, no quick fixes.
- The project will grow a lot. Structure it so the next change is easy, not so future features are pre-built. Be smart, not exhaustive.
- Keep the tree, the files and the code organised and clear without being verbose. Code explains the how by itself.
- When the change you are making tips the existing structure into being less maintainable, refactoring is part of that change. Do it now.
- Leave nothing unused: no dead code, no dormant logic, no remnant of a replaced approach. The codebase reflects exactly what it does today.

## Environment

Maintain a sandbox of your own, defined in this repository, where you can run, observe and test everything, dependencies and data included. Sessions run in parallel: each one, the user's included, starts its own instance, sharing nothing with the others, so the user can always run the project while agents run theirs. Create it if missing, keep it working and fast to start and reset.

## Verification

Never guess: run the code in the sandbox and observe. Verify the full behaviour of what you change, including its callers. Never deliver untested work.

## Tests

Write tests that block regressions. Each test costs context, maintenance and pipeline time, so every test must protect a behaviour that matters and run fast; nothing for the sake of coverage.

Lay out tests so one module's or feature's tests run alone through a scoped command. Run only the tests for your change; the full suite belongs to the pipeline.

## Comments

A comment is re-read by every agent that passes through its file and costs context each time. Once the why, the what and the how have their homes, very few comments are legitimate.

- Comment only what cannot be understood from the code itself.
- Describe the code as it is now: no former behaviour, no plans.
- Keep comments within the scope where they appear: a comment inside a function describes only that function; a file-level comment describes only that file. Never reference code or behaviour outside that scope, including as a reason for the local implementation.
- What is in your context is not what is in the code. Never record a decision abandoned along the way, an alternative you considered, or what your change replaced: after replacing A with B, do not comment that A is not used.
- Create, update and delete comments in the same change that alters the code they describe.
- If you hesitate over a comment, leave it out.

## Documentation

Documentation explains the what, in plain human English, structured for a reader. Creating a document is a deliberate choice for something that genuinely needs explaining; a word, a sentence or a section may be enough.

- Describe the present state: no history, no plans.
- What is in your context is not what the reader needs. Never document a decision abandoned along the way, an alternative you considered, or what your change replaced: after replacing A with B, document B and never mention A.
- Keep all documentation at one uniform level of detail. What you have just built looms large in your context; do not detail it more than the rest.
- Create, update and delete documentation in the same change that alters what it describes.
- If you hesitate over a sentence, leave it out.

Every document except ADRs is listed here. Read one only when the task needs it.

| Document | Covers |
| --- | --- |
| `[path]` | [What it covers] |

## ADR

Record every architecturally significant decision (structure, dependencies, interfaces, non-functional trade-offs) in `docs/decisions/NNNN-short-title.md`, NNNN incrementing. An ADR holds the why: exactly what is needed to understand the decision, nothing more.

```markdown
# NNNN. Title

Status: accepted | superseded by NNNN

## Context
## Decision
## Consequences
```

Never edit an accepted ADR beyond its status line; a new ADR supersedes it.

## Skills

Create a skill at `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` only for a task agents will repeat frequently over the life of the repository and that a written procedure makes faster or safer. Keep it current; delete it when the task disappears.

## AGENTS.md and README.md

You may edit this file only to: refresh the project description when it is no longer accurate (never to add detail); update Architecture and Layout when a change alters them; add, update or remove commands; add, update or remove a documentation entry. Everything else here is owned by the user.

README.md is the landing page for humans: description, installation, usage, commands, in clear sections. Keep it accurate and strictly minimal.
